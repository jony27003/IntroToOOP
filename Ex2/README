SpaceShip.java - Implements the Super Class for all other SpaceShips, it is an abstract class.
SpaceShipFactory.java - contains the code which is responsible for creating SpaceShip instances.
HumanSpaceShip.java - Implements the human SpaceShips which is controlled by a human.
BasherSpaceShip.java - Implements the basher SpaceShips.
AggressiveSpaceShip.java - Implements the aggresive SpaceShips.
RunnerSpaceShip.java - Implements the runner SpaceShips.
DrunkardSpaceShip.java - Implements the drunkard SpaceShips.
SpecialSpaceShip.java - Implements the special SpaceShips.



=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the functionality for different ship types in a modular way such that each type of
ship has a different class, and specific functionality can be added easily in that class.
This is implemented with inheritance - the different spaceships are sub classes of a spaceship Super Class,
which contains the operations which are common for all the different spacehips. 
If the spaceships display different behaviors then the relavent declared method in the Super Class 
is overridden by the sub classes.
There is no meaning creating a runtime SpaceShip object,
so this is an intuitive idea, as all the spaceships are physically identical, but
behave differently.
furthermore i have tried to generalize the space ships behavior as a group as much as i could, 
this made each and every sub class very simple, intuitive and short to implement.
As for the DrunkardSpaceShip - it's behavior is of a drunk pilot, herefore it performs a few selective actions at random.
The SpecialSpaceShip - displays aggressive behavior against any RunnerSpaceShip,
and a defensive behavior towards all other SpaceShips.

=============================
In order to implement the inheritance relationship described above, I defined the SpaceShip class as
abstract - the different spaceships inherit from it.
