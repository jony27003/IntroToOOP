=          Design           =
=============================
This program was designed to be flexible for multiple libraries, patrons and books.
A patron can register to different libraries, and each library handles him independently, 
giving him an independent ID. A patrons ID is not an intrinsic property of the patron itself.
Furthermore, a library can hold more than one single copy of the "same" book, 
which are distinguished by their ID, in a similar way to the patreon.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the library class, I choose to store the books and the patrons in a corresponding array, 
such that the ID of the patron and the book are represented by thier index in their corresponding arrays.
In the library and patron arrays, a null entry in the array represents an empty slot, which is open for a new book or patron.
